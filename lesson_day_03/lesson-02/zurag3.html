        "Astronaut" technically applies to all human space travelers
        regardless of nationality.

        However, astronauts fielded by Russia or the Soviet Union are
        typically known instead as cosmonauts (from the Russian "kosmos"
        (космос), meaning "space", also borrowed from Greek).
